Word in dit scherm de rondleiding gestart met de eerste exposant.                Op de kaart wordt weergegeven waar deze zich bevindt. Dan kan u de vraag en eventueel een foto ingeven en op volgende duwen waarbij u verder gaat met uw rondleiding.                Bij de laatste vraag komt u terecht op het eindscherm. Dit betekent dat u uw rondleiding heeft beeïndigt en u mag zich begeven naar het afgesproken samenkomstpunt.

Welke beurzen er zijn enzovoort.               Linksboven dit scherm ziet u het hamburgermenu met volgende opties: home, mijn groepen, beursplan, exposanten en instellingen.               Met de knop (het mannetje rechtsboven) kan u naar het instellingen scherm gaan indien u wenst uit te loggen of iets wenst aan te passen aan uw account.

Door op deze knop te duwen zal de rondleiding starten.Hierover later meer.

Men kan dit tijdens de rondleiding gebruiken               om plaatsen terug te vinden. Deze nummers komen overeen met de nummers die u tijdens uw rondleiding krijgt.
