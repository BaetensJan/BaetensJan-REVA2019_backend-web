ApplicationCore should not contain Business Logic. Rather Interfaces,
so that if 'Infrastrucutre'-module gets replaced, all interfaces in ApplicationCore
can be used by the new Infrastructure, so that all methods are implemented and everything
in 'Web' still works perfectly (without even knowing of the replacement/swap).

So: 'Infrastructure' = Business logic
'ApplicationCore' = Wall between 'Web' and 'Infrastructure' => dumb as possible (Interfaces).
